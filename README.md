# Portfolio of Projects
This portfolio contains a few projects I have been working on since I graduated with a Bachelor's in Mathematics. I use a variety of programming languages to visualise, predict, classify and forecast a variety of datasets. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding any of the projects.

## [Project 1: Building a car price prediction model using Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/Conner-cloud/Conner_Projects/tree/main/Car_price_prediction)
* Created an R program that builds a prediction model based on car specifications such as: Brand, Body type, number of cylinders and more with 91% accuracy.
* Cleans the data to ensure it is easy to read and work with.
* Removes insignificant variables from the model using Backwards Elimination, allowing us to specify what variables have the largest impact on a cars value.
* Visualises the density of car prices and models and distribution of car models.
* Visualisation of residuals to ensure we obtain a very accurate model.
After cleaning the data so that all car models were listed under the name of the brand (e.g. Volkwagen Golf 2007 -> VW) I plotted the distribution of car models.
